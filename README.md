This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Things to note
Please view this website on a laptop or desktop device - I haven't had the time to make it viewable on mobile yet. 
Also a lot of inspiration came from (as you can probably tell) [Brittany Chiang's site](https://brittanychiang.com/) and [Kuon Yagi's site](https://kuon.space/#top)
so credit to them!

Also it uhhhh... only looks okay in Chrome because I forgot other browers existed while developing it :D
